This article is my contribution to the MAUI.NET July event 2025 hosted by Matt Goldman (https://goforgoldman.com/posts/mauiuijuly-25/).

# Introduction
MauiReactor is the library I maintain and use almost daily to build applications for Android and iOS: built on top of .NET MAUI, it allows developers to write code using an MVU approach (if you are new to MauiReactor or the MVU pattern, please take a look at the [MauiReactor site](https://github.com/adospace/reactorui-maui) for samples and documentation).

When you start a new project, especially for new clients, often you're required to create some sort of preliminary work (or an MVP) to experiment UX designs or to help the client to better figure out their requirements.
Most of the time, you do not yet have any UI design to follow. 

Other times, it can happen that you want to test some new approach on existing applications, but are not yet sure which UI/UX pattern to follow.

In this post, I want to introduce a new prototyping kit package for MauiReactor that should ease this process, providing several prebuilt components, like textboxes, number inputs, or tabs, that you can just drop into your project and use right away.

The main idea behind the toolkit is to give you an application theme that defines styles and controls for your prototypes (hence the name Prototyping Kit) that seamlessly integrate with MauiReactor.

The theme follows the excellent Figma design [Mobile Apps – Prototyping Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1129468881607079432) from [Renata Pôrto](https://www.figma.com/@renataporto).
